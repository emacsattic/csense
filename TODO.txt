Things to do
============

For release
-----------

- handling scopes without blocks (foreach, for, etc)

- arrays

- honor protection levels 

- handle inherited members 

- fun overload by param num

- caching of assemblies, source class lookups

- document how the backend works

- url formatting should bemoved to csense-cs

- bold current params

- help for constructors

- parameter documentation

- auto help

- constructors in completions

- check if everything is having a documentation, except generic stuff

  it seems inherited overloaded methods do not usually have
  documentation even if the assembly is documented. probably the
  documentation of the original definition should be used

- show help only fur functions with matching parameters

- what should happen if a a standalone symbol is completed? offer
  local variables? (limit: 50)

- exact completion


Someday 
-------

- casting

- overloaded functions differing by param type

- handling base.something

- skip construtor initializers : base()... , so that arglist of
  constructors can be parsed properly

- using explicit namespaces as prefix (e.g. System.Console after
  "using System;")

- skip stuff in comments and strings

- method parameters with default values

- static functions

- function doc for generic methods (e.g. List.Add)

  M:System.Collections.Generic.List`1.Add(`0)

  what is `0? probably refelction should be used to handle generic
  stuff properly

- tooltip is hidden immediately if mouse cursor is in the way, though
  the cursor is moved away first. why is that?

- check all forward/backward-sexps for error checking

  or maybe they should be left as is, so that the user is notified of
  syntax errors?
