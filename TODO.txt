Things to do
============

For release
-----------

- should work only within functions!

- function template (better word, signature?)

- handling scopes without blocks (foreach, for, etc)

- arrays

- honor protection levels 

- handle inherited members 

- caching of assemblies, source class lookups

- private fields shouldn't be returned for external assemblies

- bold references in doc

- document how the backend works


Someday
-------

- overloaded functions

- handling base.something

- construtor initializers : base()...

- creating objects

- using explicit namespaces as prefix (e.g. System.Console after
  "using System;")

- skip stuff in comments and strings

- add aliases for displaying common classes

- shortened class names for symbols in the same assembly in documentation

- completion for other places too (e.g. after = new ...)
