Things to do
============

For release
-----------

- function template (better word, signature?)

- handling scopes without blocks (foreach, for, etc)

- arrays

- honor protection levels 

- handle inherited members 

- caching of assemblies, source class lookups

- document how the backend works

- check all forward/backward-sexps for error checking

- url formatting should bemoved to csense-cs

- bold current params

- help for constructors

- overloads from source too (implement inheritance first?)

- parameter documentation

- auto help

- constructors in completions

- properties with signatures, eg: P:System.String.Chars(System.Int32)

- check if everything is having a documentation, except generic stuff


Someday 
-------

- casting

- overloaded functions

- handling base.something

- construtor initializers : base()...

- creating objects

- using explicit namespaces as prefix (e.g. System.Console after
  "using System;")

- skip stuff in comments and strings

- completion for other places too (e.g. after = new ...)

- default values

- static functions

- function doc for generic methods (e.g. List.Add)

  M:System.Collections.Generic.List`1.Add(`0)

  what is `0? probably refelction should be used to handle generic
  stuff properly

- tooltip is hidden immediately if mouse cursor is in the way, though
  the cursor is moved away first. why is that?

- it seems inherited overloaded methods do not usually have
  documentation even if the assembly is documented. probably the
  documentation of the original definition should be used
