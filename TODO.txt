Things to do
============

For release
-----------

- handling scopes without blocks (foreach, for, etc)

- handle inherited members 

- honor protection levels 

- fun overload by param num

- bold current params

- help for constructors

- parameter documentation

- constructors in completions

- what should happen if a a standalone symbol is completed? offer
  local variables? (limit: 50)

- exact completion

- static functions

- auto help

- caching of assemblies, source class lookups

- check if everything is having a documentation, except generic stuff

  it seems inherited overloaded methods do not usually have
  documentation even if the assembly is documented. probably the
  documentation of the original definition should be used

- document how the backend works



Someday 
-------

- handle namespace of classes retrieved from source

- handle casting

- overloaded functions differing in param type

- overloading methods with default parameter values

- handling base.something

- skip construtor initializers when parsing function argument
   ...) : base()... 

- using explicit full or partial namespaces as prefix
  (e.g. System.Console after "using System;")

- skip stuff in comments and strings

- function doc for generic methods (e.g. List.Add)

  M:System.Collections.Generic.List`1.Add(`0)

  what is `0? probably refelction should be used to handle generic
  stuff properly

- check all forward/backward-sexps for error checking

  or maybe they should be left as is, so that the user is notified of
  syntax errors?

- tooltip is hidden immediately if mouse cursor is in the way, though
  the cursor is moved away first. why is that?
